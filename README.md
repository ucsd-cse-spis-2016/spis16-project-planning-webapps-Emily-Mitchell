# Brief Description
We plan on doing a Matchmaker. What we think we will do is that a person answers questions and is suggested people with similar interests, potentially in the form of one boy and one girl. If we have time, we will also implement a Randomizer. With this, a person inputs variables (numbers, phrases, names, etc.) and is given a random variable back, and will include a general randomizer and a specific one for the game Truth or Dare.

#Stages
Stage 1: Implement a 10-part questionairre that stores data, and calls it to match up people.
Stage 2: Make a randomizer that rolls a random input from a given list.
Stage 3: Make a specialized randomizer like the old one, but used for Truth or Dare.
Stage 4: Design a webapp that can call each of the previous programs at any point.
