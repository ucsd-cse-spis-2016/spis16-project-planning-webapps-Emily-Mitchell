# Brief Description
We plan on doing a Matchmaker. What we think we will do is that a person answers questions and is suggested people with similar interests, potentially in the form of one boy and one girl. If we have time, we will also implement a Randomizer. With this, a person inputs variables (numbers, phrases, names, etc.) and is given a random variable back, and will include a general randomizer and a specific one for the game Truth or Dare.

#Stages

Stage 1: Implement a 10-part questionairre that stores data, and calls it to match up people. Using the data from Phill's survey, we would create dictionaries for each SPIS student and would store that on the site. We would make an algorithm that, when a name is put in the site, would match that to the top three students with similar interests.

Stage 2: Make a randomizer that rolls a random input from a given list.

Stage 3: Make a specialized randomizer like the old one, but used for Truth or Dare.

Stage 4: Design a webapp that can call each of the previous programs at any point.
